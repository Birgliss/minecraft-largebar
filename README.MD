# LargeBar

A mod that doubles the size of the vanilla hotbar, from 9 slots to 18. It doesn't add any extra inventory slots, it just
uses some that already exist in the player's inventory.

___

## Compatibility
This mod is designed to only change what is absolutely required for functionality. At the time of writing all of the
known crashes are a result of the other mods assuming that there are only 9 slots and not using the built-in Vanilla
mechanism for finding the size of the hotbar.
